Instructions: Upon running the PlayerEntryScreen in the virtual machine, the user will be asked to enter a numeric player ID. If the ID is not already found, the program will recognize the user as a new player, and recognize them as a returning player if the ID has been found. The user is then asked to input their code name and equipment ID. After entering this data, the program will continue to ask for player IDs along with code names and equipment IDs until F5 is pressed, which will exit the loop. Finally, the program will display a table showing each player's ID alongside their corresponding codenames.
